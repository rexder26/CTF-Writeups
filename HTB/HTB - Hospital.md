Dear Lucy,  
  
I wanted to remind you that the project for lighter, cheaper and  
environmentally friendly needles is still ongoing ðŸ’‰. You are the one in  
charge of providing me with the designs for these so that I can take  
them to the 3D printing department and start producing them right away.  
Please make the design in an ".eps" file format so that it can be well  
visualized with GhostScript.  
  
Best regards,  
Chris Brown.  
ðŸ˜ƒ
