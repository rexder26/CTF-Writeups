```shell
PS C:\inetpub\wwwroot> cat user/db.php
<?php
// Enter your Host, username, password, database below.
// I left password empty because i do not set password on localhost.
$con = mysqli_connect("localhost","dbuser","36mEAhz/B8xQ~2VM","sniper");

Hi Chris,
	Your php skillz suck. Contact yamitenshi so that he teaches you how to use it and after that fix the website as there are a lot of bugs on it. And I hope that you've prepared the documentation for our new app. Drop it here when you're done with it.

Regards,
Sniper CEO

- This Means, The Admin want to see the documentation and The instrustion tells Us that the format have to be CHM it is compiled HTML.
- For that i can Create A chm on my windows i can do simple smb request and crack the hash to get the password of the admin because th admin will be there to get the documentation of the project.
- I used this for the CHM then COnverted it to chm.
